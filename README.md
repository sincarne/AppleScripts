# AppleScripts intended for personal use #

This repository contains all the AppleScripts I've written or adapted for personal use. I don't intend for them to be earth-shattering, they just scratch some personal itches.

## Duplicate Finder Window - `closetabstoright.scpt` ##

For Safari. Closes all tabs to the right of the current tab.


## Duplicate Finder Window - `duplicatefinderwindow.scpt` ##

Opens a new window in the Finder, and sets the location to that of the previously foremost window.

## Duplicate Finder Tab - `duplicatefindertab.scpt` ##

Opens a new tab in the front Finder window, and sets the location to that of the previously foremost tab.

## New message with attachments in Sparrow - `newmessageinsparrow.scpt` ##

Set as a service. Gets selected files and folders, and creates a new message in Finder with specified files attached.

## Clean By Kind - `cleanbykind.scpt` ##

In Lion, the default folder view behaviour became "Arrange by ...", a view that hides most of the files in a folder. I prefer the old "Clean by kind". This script lives in my Finder toolbar for a quick clean up, and in my script menu bound to a key.

## New Text File - `newtextfile.scpt` ##

I like the ability in Windows to right-click and create a new text file. This script replicates that behaviour with the `touch` command. Add it as a service so it appears in the CTRL-click menu.

## Quit All - `quitall.scpt` ##

I frequently find myself with a dock full of one-off apps I use during the development process. I use this script to kill all but my core applications.
